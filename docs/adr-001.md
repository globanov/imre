# ADR-001: Monolith with Async Worker for WFM MVP

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to build a minimal but production-grade workforce management (WFM) service for retail in 8 hours. The system must:
- Handle shift scheduling
- Calculate weekly workload per store
- Demonstrate understanding of sync/async integration and scalability

## Decision
Use a **monolithic Django application** for core logic (shifts, staff, stores) and an **async worker** (Python/FastAPI) for aggregation, connected via Redis Streams.

## Consequences
### Pros
- Fast development and deployment
- Clear bounded context: `wfm_core` vs `aggregation`
- Scalable analytics: worker can be scaled independently
- Demonstrates event-driven architecture without microservice overhead

### Cons
- Slight operational complexity (two processes)
- Requires careful error handling in event processing

## Alternatives Considered
- **Pure monolith**: simpler, but doesn’t show async/scalability skills
- **Full microservices**: too time-consuming for 8-hour MVP
